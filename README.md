# COMPARATIVE-STUDY-OF-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHM
The main scope of this repository is learn and get idea about the new and emerging era based on machine learning and its algorithms . Firstly about the introduction of machine learning and its usefulness in the present modern era where we have defined then types of machine learning on the basis of their application and type of approach they take for their implementation.
We have explained the algorithms of each specific category and tabulated them on the basis of their advantage, disadvantage and application.

We have implemented the linear regression, gradient descent, decision tree, svm of Boston housing dataset and analyzed the performance of specific model on the basis of mean squared error.
Also implemented the k means clustering algorithm in finding the clusters on the basis of elbow method.

Repository also covers some of the major problems in implementing the machine learning algorithms.
